    "text": "Suppose you want to find out the “true” network of social ties between \\(n\\) individuals and you query \\(m\\) “reporters” within this network (where \\(m \\le n\\)) about such ties. These ties could, for instance, represent relationships commonly studied in the social sciences — such as loaning money, giving advice, or sharing food.\nSuppose, also, that you ask them questions in both directions: “Who comes to person \\(i\\) to borrow money?” But also, “Who does person \\(i\\) go to when borrowing money?” As it is doubtful that the responses given by the reporters will match perfectly, you will almost surely end up with varying perspectives on what should be the same relationship and, so too, varying perspectives on the structure of the overall social network. The question then is, how do you make sense of this data in the face of inconsistent reports and potentially unreliable reporters?\nThe model in the VIMuRe package is our proposed solution to this problem. It fits a latent network model from multiply-sampled social network data using Bayesian inference, returning a posterior distribution that can later be used to obtain samples or a point-estimate network (e.g., as an igraph object). The package was written in Python and R and is available on GitHub (https://github.com/latentnetworks/vimure).\n\n\n\nInput: multiply-sampled social network data as a list of adjacency matrices or igraph objects.\nOutput: a fitted latent network model that can be used to obtain samples or a point-estimate network (an igraph object) from the posterior distribution of the fitted model."

    "text": "VIMuRe is available in both R and Python. The R implementation is a wrapper around the Python implementation. Both packages are in active development and are not yet on CRAN or PyPI. Use the installation instructions below to install the latest development version.\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nStep 01: install reticulate with the following command:\ninstall.packages(\"reticulate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I need this package?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur core code is written in python, so we use reticulate to integrate our model in R. This package allows you to use Python within your R session in a seamless, high-performance interoperable way.\nreticulate will look for python installed in your computer. If, for some reason, it cannot find it, you may be prompted to download and install miniconda.\n\nMiniconda is the recommended installation method for most users, as it is easier to ensure that the newly installed python is isolated from other python installs you have in your system.\nIf you initially declined the miniconda installation prompt, you can later manually install miniconda by running reticulate::install_miniconda().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 02: install vimure==0.1 with the following command:\nrequire(devtools)\ndevtools::install_github(\"latentnetworks/vimure\", subdir=\"src/R\", ref=\"develop\")\nStep 03: Finally, you must install the Python package as well. This is because the R package is a wrapper around the Python package. To install the Python package, follow the instructions below.\nrequire(vimure)\nvimure::install_vimure()\nIf you are not using RStudio, i.e., you are using R in the terminal, you may need to restart your R session after installing the Python package.\nStep 04: To confirm that the installation was successful, run the following command:\nlibrary(vimure)\nvimure::vm_config()\nYou should see something like the following:\n#> Loaded vimure version\n#> Vimure v (...)\n#> Python v3.x (...)\n\n\n\nInstall vimure==0.1 with the following command:\npip install \"git+https://github.com/latentnetworks/vimure.git#egg=vimure&subdirectory=src/python/\"\nThis Python package was tested on Python >= 3.6, and it is expected to work fine in all OSes.\nRead more about the Python setup for development here."
