Specifically, they asked about borrowing and receiving money, giving and receiving advice, borrowing and lending household items like kerosene and rice, and visiting and receiving guests. These distinct questions are represented in the data files with the following names:\n\nlendmoney,\nborrowmoney,\ngiveadvice,\nhelpdecision,\nkeroricecome,\nkeroricego,\nvisitcome\nvisitgo\n\nEach of these relationships is stored in a separate file. For example, the file lendmoney1.csv contains information on who reported lending money to whom in village 1.\nWe can read each of these files using the read.csv() function. For example:\nfilepath_lendmoney <- file.path(RAW_CSV_FOLDER, paste(\"lendmoney\", selected_village, \".csv\", sep=\"\"))\nlendmoney <- read.csv(filepath_lendmoney, header = FALSE, as.is = TRUE, na = ALL_NA_CODES)\nThe ALL_NA_CODES variable is a vector of all the codes that, after inspection, we identified were used to represent missing values in the data:\nALL_NA_CODES <- c(\"9999999\", \"5555555\", \"7777777\", \"0\")\nWhat the data look like\nThe data is stored here as a node list, but it will need to be further pre-processed as an edge list:\n\n\n\n\nV1\nV2\nV3\nV4\nV5\nV6\nV7\nV8\nV9\n\n\n\n\n100201\n107603\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n100202\n102902\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n100601\n101901\n102601\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n100602\n100501\n101902\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n100701\n100801\n102101\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n100702\n100801\n104001\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\nEach row represents reports made by a single individual; the first number is the pid (the “person identifier”) of the individual who reported the relationship, whereas the remaining however many numbers listed in the same row are the pids of the individuals who were reported to be involved in the relationship."

This is because the survey asked two different questions about borrowing and receiving money. The process is the same as before, except that we need to flip the ego and alter columns at the end.\nThere are also some other data cleaning steps that we need to perform: remove self-loops, remove duplicates and keep only reports made by registered reporters. We will do all of that inside a function in the next section, to make it easier to re-use."

That is, if \\(i\\) reports that \\(j\\) lends money to them, then \\(i\\) is likely to report that \\(j\\) also borrows money from them.\nThis is a network-wide parameter and encompasses all layers. If you have reasons to believe mutuality varies across layers, you have to re-run the model for each layer separately.\n\n\n3.1.2: Under-reporting vs over-reporting: a combination of (\\(\\theta_{lm} \\times \\lambda_{lk}\\))\nFirst, let’s look at the shape of the \\(\\theta\\) array:\ndim(posterior_estimates[['theta']])\n   4 417\nWe only have one layer, so the first dimension is 1. The second dimension is the number of reporters in the network. In our case, this shows that VIMuRe infers that there are 417 reporters in the network.\nThis parameter, combined with \\(\\lambda_{lk}\\) represents the “reliability” of a reporter \\(m\\) on layer \\(l\\):\ndim(posterior_estimates[['lambda']])\n 4 2\nThe first dimension is the number of layers \\(l\\), and the second dimension is the strength of the tie, which in this case can assume the values \\(k \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\). We only have two possible values for \\(k\\) because that is the default setting for the VimureModel class. If you want to model more than two possible values for \\(k\\), you can set the K parameter when running the fit function: model.fit(..., K=3).\nCombined, these two parameters indicate the probability that a reporter will tend to report ties, in general, for a given layer (recall the expected value of the VIMuRe model shown in Section 3.1: Posterior Estimates). Loosely speaking, we can think of this value as the “reliability” of a reporter on a given layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother note on the number of reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might be wondering why there are so many reporters, 417. After all, in Section 2.2: Number of reporters, we calculated this number to be around 200! This is due to a technicality in the way the VIMuRe package handles the data. Our current implementation represents the total number of reporters, \\(M\\) as \\(M = N\\) (i.e. the number of nodes is equal to the number of reporters).\nThis is akin to saying each node has the potential to be a reporter. But to control for which nodes are actually reporters, we use a binary mask, \\(R_{lijm}\\), which is 1 if the node \\(m\\) is a reporter on layer \\(l\\) for the tie between nodes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) and 0 otherwise. You can control how this mask is built by passing the R parameter to the fit() method. Read more about it in section 3.3: A note on the reporter mask (R).\nChanging this is a priority for the next version of the package. But, as it is not a trivial change, we have decided to leave it as it is for now.\n\n\n\nHow are reporters’ “reliability” distributed across layers?\nLet’s check which reporters have the highest “reliability” values, and plot the values for each layer:\n\n\nClick to see the code\n\n# Get the node mapping: which node corresponds to which index in the array\ndf_nodes <- model$nodeNames\n\n# Which nodes are reporters?\n# Note: this assumes you have a `reporters` list from Tutorial 01\nid_reporters <- df_nodes %>% filter(name %in% reporters) %>% pull(id)\n\ndf_lambda_k1 <- data.frame(\n  layer = model$layerNames,\n  lambda_k1 = posterior_estimates$lambda[,2]\n)\n\ndf_theta_reporters <- purrr::map_dfr(id_reporters, ~ {\n  reporter_id <- .x\n  purrr::map_dfr(seq_along(model$layerNames), ~ {\n    l <- .x\n    layer_name <- model$layerNames[l]\n    theta <- posterior_estimates$theta[l, reporter_id] * df_lambda_k1$lambda_k1[l]\n    reporter_name <- df_nodes$name[reporter_id]\n    tibble(\n      layer = layer_name,\n      reporter_id = reporter_id,\n      reporter_name = reporter_name,\n      theta_scaled = theta\n    )\n  })\n})\n\n\n# Sort by reliability (scaled by lambda_k=1)\ndf_theta_reporters %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = layer, values_from = theta_scaled, values_fn = list) %>%\n  select(-1) %>%\n  unnest(cols = everything(), names_repair = \"unique\") %>%\n  arrange(desc(advice), desc(kerorice), desc(money), desc(visit)) %>%\n  head()\n\n\n\nClick to see the code\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nCOLORS =  c('#E69F25', '#5CB4E4', '#069F72', '#F1E545', '#0773B2', '#CC79A8')\n\ng = (ggplot(df_theta_reporters,  aes(x=theta_scaled, fill=layer)) +\n     geom_histogram(binwidth=0.1, color=\"#212121\") +\n     theme_bw() + \n     facet_grid(layer ~ ., scales=\"free_y\") +\n     scale_fill_manual(values=COLORS, guide=\"none\") +\n     theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=10),\n           axis.text.y=element_text(size=10),\n           panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),\n           panel.grid.major=element_blank(),           \n           strip.background = element_blank(),\n           strip.text.x = element_text(size=10),\n           axis.title=element_text(size=16)) +\n    scale_x_continuous(name = expression(paste(theta * lambda[k==1])), \n                      breaks = seq(0, 1.1, by = 0.1), \n                      limits = c(0, 1.1)) +\n     scale_y_continuous(name=\"Count\", breaks=seq(0, 60, by=10), limits=c(0, 50)) +\n     ggtitle(expression(paste(\"Reliability distribution across layers (\", theta[{l}], \" \\u00D7 \", lambda[k==1], \")\"))))\n\nggsave(plot=g, filename=\"theta_reporters.png\", width=7, height=9, dpi=300)\n\n\nHow should we interpret the values?\nThe interpretation depends on both the mutuality of the network and the survey design. If the mutuality is high (as indicated by \\(\\nu\\) being closer to 1), reporters will naturally tend to reciprocate the ties they report, by default, thus reporters with high \\(\\theta\\) values (relative to the \\(\\theta\\) distribution) are likely “over-reporting” ties.\nLet’s investigate this a bit further by checking the ties reported by a top reporter (113302) in the advice layer:\n\nReporters ranked by advice “reliability”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreporter_name\nadvice\nkerorice\nmoney\nvisit\n\n\n\n\n113302\n0.8970675\n0.7397009\n0.4591973\n0.2099856\n\n\n113901\n0.8780586\n0.8209907\n0.8680566\n0.6693385\n\n\n109902\n0.8504384\n0.7928275\n0.0000155\n0.6415688\n\n\n109505\n0.8504182\n0.0000130\n0.8384146\n0.8622429\n\n\n105902\n0.8504050\n0.0000128\n0.4580637\n0.3737390\n\n\n105402\n0.8503861\n0.5638047\n0.4760844\n0.7225281\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost reporters have reliability in the \\([0.4, 0.6]\\) interval, but 113302 has a “reliability” of \\(\\approx 0.9\\) in the advice layer.

(Note that these two non-reporter nodes will have reliability values of \\(\\approx 0\\)).\nOn top of that, when we look at the reports made by the remaining four reporters, only node 113301 confirms the helpdecision tie reported by 113302:\npotential_friends = c(\"110502\", \"110501\", \"113601\", \"113301\")\n\nedgelist %>% filter(reporter %in% potential_friends & (ego == \"113302\" | alter == \"113302\"))\n\n\n\nego\nalter\nreporter\ntie_type\nlayer\nweight\n\n\n\n\n113301\n113302\n113301\ngiveadvice\nadvice\n1\n\n\n\nThat is why 113302’s \\(\\theta\\lambda_{k=1}\\) is high: they report a lot of ties, but only one of them is confirmed by other reporters.\nNodes with values in the average range of the \\(\\theta_{lm}\\lambda_{lk}\\) distribution is likely to be more “reliable” reporters."

    "text": "3.3: A note on the reporter mask (R)\nWhile nodes and reporters are simple lists of strings, the reporter mask R is a multidimensional sparse logical array (a tensor) with dimensions \\(L \\times N \\times N \\times N\\). Here, R[l, i, j, m] indicates that reporter \\(m\\) can report on the tie between \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) if the tie belongs to layer \\(l\\).\nSo, for example, if the survey design was such that reporters could only report on ties involving themselves, this implies:\n\\[\\begin{cases}\n\nR_{lijm} = 1 & \\text{if } i = m \\text{ or } j = m \\\\\nR_{lijm} = 0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\n\\end{cases}\\]\nDepending on your survey design, you might want to construct R manually. For example, if all reporters were asked about all ties – regardless of whether they were involved in the ties or not – then R would be a multi-dimensional array of ones. We are planning a future tutorial on how to handle different survey designs.\nIt’s worth noting that currently, the last dimension has size \\(N\\) instead of \\(M\\). This is because the current implementation of the code assumes that all reporters are part of the network. The mathematical model, as described in (De Bacco et al. 2023), is more flexible and supports an arbitrary set of reporters, whether they are a subset of nodes or not. However, we have not yet implemented this functionality in the code. Our survey designs have so far assumed that all reporters are part of the network, so this has not been a problem. If this is a feature you would like to see sooner, let us know by adding a discussion on GitHub."

    "text": "3.3 Read reports per relationship type\nThe survey that produced this data collected information on a number of different types of relationships, four of which were “double sampled” (i.e., asked about in two ways, who people go to for that type of support, and who comes to them). Specifically, they asked about borrowing and receiving money, giving and receiving advice, borrowing and lending household items like kerosene and rice, and visiting and receiving guests. These distinct questions are represented in the data files with the following names:\n\nlendmoney,\nborrowmoney,\ngiveadvice,\nhelpdecision,\nkeroricecome,\nkeroricego,\nvisitcome\nvisitgo\n\nEach of these relationships is stored in a separate file. For example, the file lendmoney1.csv contains information on who reported lending money to whom in village 1.\nWe can read each of these files using the pd.read_csv() function. For example:\nfilepath_lendmoney = os.path.join(RAW_CSV_FOLDER, f\"lendmoney{selected_village}.csv\")\nlendmoney = pd.read_csv(filepath_lendmoney, header=None, na_values=ALL_NA_CODES, dtype=str)\nThe ALL_NA_CODES variable is a vector of all the codes that, after inspection, we identified were used to represent missing values in the data:\nALL_NA_CODES = [\"9999999\", \"5555555\", \"7777777\", \"0\"]\nWhat the data look like\nThe data is stored here as a node list, but it will need to be further pre-processed as an edge list:\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n\n\n\n100201\n107603\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\n\n\n100202\n102902\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\n\n\n100601\n101901\n102601\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\n\n\n100602\n100501\n101902\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\n\n\n100701\n100801\n102101\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\nnan\n\n\n\n\nEach row represents reports made by a single individual; the first number is the pid (the “person identifier”) of the individual who reported the relationship, whereas the remaining however many numbers listed in the same row are the pids of the individuals who were reported to be involved in the relationship."

This is because the survey asked two different questions about borrowing and receiving money. The process is the same as before, except that we need to flip the ego and alter columns at the end.\nThere are also some other data cleaning steps that we need to perform: remove self-loops, remove duplicates and keep only reports made by registered reporters. We will do all of that inside a function in the next section, to make it easier to re-use."

That is, if \\(i\\) reports that \\(j\\) lends money to them, then \\(i\\) is likely to report that \\(j\\) also borrows money from them.\nThis is a network-wide parameter and encompasses all layers. If you have reasons to believe mutuality varies across layers, you have to re-run the model for each layer separately.\n\n\n3.1.2: Under-reporting vs over-reporting: a combination of (\\(\\theta_{lm} \\times \\lambda_{lk}\\))\nFirst, let’s look at the shape of the \\(\\theta\\) array:\nposterior_estimates['theta'].shape\n(4, 417)\nWe only have one layer, so the first dimension is 1. The second dimension is the number of reporters in the network. In our case, this shows that VIMuRe infers that there are 417 reporters in the network.\nThis parameter, combined with \\(\\lambda_{lk}\\) represents the “reliability” of a reporter \\(m\\) on layer \\(l\\):\nposterior_estimates['lambda'].shape\n(4, 2)\nThe first dimension is the number of layers \\(l\\), and the second dimension is the strength of the tie, which in this case can assume the values \\(k \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\). We only have two possible values for \\(k\\) because that is the default setting for the VimureModel class. If you want to model more than two possible values for \\(k\\), you can set the K parameter when running the fit function: model.fit(..., K=3).\nCombined, these two parameters indicate the probability that a reporter will tend to report ties, in general, for a given layer (recall the expected value of the VIMuRe model shown in Section 3.1: Posterior Estimates). Loosely speaking, we can think of this value as the “reliability” of a reporter on a given layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother note on the number of reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might be wondering why there are so many reporters, 417. After all, in Section 2.2: Number of reporters, we calculated this number to be around 200! This is due to a technicality in the way the VIMuRe package handles the data. Our current implementation represents the total number of reporters, \\(M\\) as \\(M = N\\) (i.e. the number of nodes is equal to the number of reporters).\nThis is akin to saying each node has the potential to be a reporter. But to control for which nodes are actually reporters, we use a binary mask, \\(R_{lijm}\\), which is 1 if the node \\(m\\) is a reporter on layer \\(l\\) for the tie between nodes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) and 0 otherwise. You can control how this mask is built by passing the R parameter to the fit() method. Read more about it in section 3.3: A note on the reporter mask (R).\nChanging this is a priority for the next version of the package. But, as it is not a trivial change, we have decided to leave it as it is for now.\n\n\n\nHow are reporters’ “reliability” distributed across layers?\nLet’s check which reporters have the highest “reliability” values, and plot the values for each layer:\n\n\nClick to see the code\n\n# Get the node mapping: which node corresponds to which index in the array\ndf_nodes = model.nodeNames\n\n# Which nodes are reporters?\n# Note: this assumes you have a `reporters` list from Tutorial 01\nid_reporters = df_nodes[df_nodes['name'].isin(reporters)][\"id\"].values\n\ndf_lambda_k1 = pd.DataFrame(dict(layer=model.layerNames, lambda_k1=posterior_estimates['lambda'][:,1]))\n\n# Add the theta values\ndf_theta_reporters = [\n    (layer_name, reporter_id, df_nodes['name'].iloc[reporter_id], posterior_estimates['theta'][l, reporter_id] * df_lambda_k1['lambda_k1'].iloc[l])\n    for reporter_id in id_reporters\n    for l, layer_name in enumerate(model.layerNames)]\n\ndf_theta_reporters = \\\n    pd.DataFrame(df_theta_reporters, \n                 columns=['layer', 'reporter_id', 'reporter_name', 'theta_scaled'])\n\n# Sort by reliability (scaled by lambda_k=1)\ndf_theta_reporters\\\n    .pivot(index=['reporter_id', 'reporter_name'], \n           columns=['layer'], \n           values=['theta_scaled'])\\\n    .droplevel(0, axis=1)\\\n    .reset_index()\\\n    .sort_values(by=model.layerNames, ascending=False)\\\n    .head()\n\n\n\nClick to see the code\n\n\n# plotnine is the python equivalent of ggplot2\nfrom plotnine import *\n\nplot_df = df_theta_reporters.copy()\n\nCOLORS =  ['#E69F25', '#5CB4E4', '#069F72', '#F1E545', '#0773B2', '#CC79A8']\n\ng = (ggplot(plot_df,  aes(x=\"theta_scaled\", fill=\"layer\")) +\n     geom_histogram(binwidth=0.1, color=\"#212121\") +\n     theme_bw() + \n     facet_grid(\"layer ~ .\", scales=\"free_y\") +\n     scale_fill_manual(values=COLORS, guide=False) +\n     theme(figure_size=(6, 3),\n           axis_text_x=element_text(size=10),\n           axis_text_y=element_text(size=10),\n           panel_grid_minor=element_blank(),\n           panel_grid_major=element_blank(),           \n           strip_background = element_blank(),\n           strip_text_x = element_text(size=10),\n           axis_title=element_text(size=16)) +\n     scale_x_continuous(name=r\"$\\theta \\times \\lambda_{k=1}$\", breaks=np.arange(0, 1.1, 0.1), limits=(0, 1.1)) +\n     scale_y_continuous(name=\"Count\", breaks=np.arange(0, 60, 10), limits=(0, 50)) +\n     ggtitle(r\"Reliability distribution across layers ($\\theta_l \\times \\lambda_{k=1}$)\"))\n\nggsave(g, \"theta_reporters.png\", width=7, height=9, dpi=300)\n\n\nHow should we interpret the values?\nThe interpretation depends on both the mutuality of the network and the survey design. If the mutuality is high (as indicated by \\(\\nu\\) being closer to 1), reporters will naturally tend to reciprocate the ties they report, by default, thus reporters with high \\(\\theta\\) values (relative to the \\(\\theta\\) distribution) are likely “over-reporting” ties.\nLet’s investigate this a bit further by checking the ties reported by a top reporter (113302) in the advice layer:\n\nReporters ranked by advice “reliability”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreporter_id\nreporter_name\nadvice\nkerorice\nmoney\nvisit\n\n\n\n\n120\n113302\n0.897073\n0.73975\n0.459182\n0.209975\n\n\n124\n113901\n0.878063\n0.820995\n0.868054\n0.669433\n\n\n97\n109902\n0.850442\n0.792795\n1.55569e-05\n0.641589\n\n\n92\n109505\n0.850422\n1.29801e-05\n0.838414\n0.86224\n\n\n56\n105902\n0.850409\n1.27773e-05\n0.458103\n0.37393\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost reporters have reliability in the \\([0.4, 0.6]\\) interval, but 113302 has a “reliability” of \\(\\approx 0.9\\) in the advice layer. Let’s check the ties reported by this reporter:\nedgelist[(edgelist[\"reporter\"] == \"113302\") & (edgelist[\"layer\"] == \"advice\")]\n\nTies reported by 113302 in the layer advice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nego\nalter\nreporter\ntie_type\nlayer\nweight\n\n\n\n\n113302\n110502\n113302\ngiveadvice\nadvice\n1\n\n\n113302\n113102\n113302\ngiveadvice\nadvice\n1\n\n\n105701\n113302\n113302\nhelpdecision\nadvice\n1\n\n\n110501\n113302\n113302\nhelpdecision\nadvice\n1\n\n\n113601\n113302\n113302\nhelpdecision\nadvice\n1\n\n\n113301\n113302\n113302\nhelpdecision\nadvice\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode 113302 does not report any reciprocal ties, but they do report ties with six other nodes.\nAre all nodes also reporters?\nTwo of these six nodes are not reporters:\nnodes_mentioned = [\"110502\", \"113102\", \"105701\", \"110501\", \"113601\", \"113301\"]\nnot_reporters = [x for x in nodes_mentioned if x not in reporters]\nnot_reporters\n['113102', '105701']\nWe will never be able to confirm ties between 113302 and these nodes and this is already one of the reasons why 113302’s “reliability” is high. (Note that these two non-reporter nodes will have reliability values of \\(\\approx 0\\)).\nOn top of that, when we look at the reports made by the remaining four reporters, only node 113301 confirms the helpdecision tie reported by 113302:\npotential_friends = [\"110502\", \"110501\", \"113601\", \"113301\"]\n\nedgelist[(edgelist['reporter'].isin(potential_friends)) & \n         ((edgelist['ego'] == '113302') | (edgelist['alter'] == '113302'))]\n\n\n\nego\nalter\nreporter\ntie_type\nlayer\nweight\n\n\n\n\n113301\n113302\n113301\ngiveadvice\nadvice\n1\n\n\n\nThat is why 113302’s \\(\\theta\\lambda_{k=1}\\) is high: they report a lot of ties, but only one of them is confirmed by other reporters.\nNodes with values in the average range of the \\(\\theta_{lm}\\lambda_{lk}\\) distribution is likely to be more “reliable” reporters."

If you would like to set the nodes, reporters, and reporter mask explicitly, you can pass these values as arguments to the fit() method.

    "text": "3.3: A note on the reporter mask (R)\nWhile nodes and reporters are simple lists of strings, the reporter mask R is a multidimensional sparse logical array (a tensor) with dimensions \\(L \\times N \\times N \\times N\\). Here, R[l, i, j, m] indicates that reporter \\(m\\) can report on the tie between \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) if the tie belongs to layer \\(l\\).\nSo, for example, if the survey design was such that reporters could only report on ties involving themselves, this implies:\n\\[\\begin{cases}\n\nR_{lijm} = 1 & \\text{if } i = m \\text{ or } j = m \\\\\nR_{lijm} = 0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\n\\end{cases}\\]\nDepending on your survey design, you might want to construct R manually. For example, if all reporters were asked about all ties – regardless of whether they were involved in the ties or not – then R would be a multi-dimensional array of ones. We are planning a future tutorial on how to handle different survey designs.\nIt’s worth noting that currently, the last dimension has size \\(N\\) instead of \\(M\\). This is because the current implementation of the code assumes that all reporters are part of the network. The mathematical model, as described in (De Bacco et al. 2023), is more flexible and supports an arbitrary set of reporters, whether they are a subset of nodes or not. However, we have not yet implemented this functionality in the code. Our survey designs have so far assumed that all reporters are part of the network, so this has not been a problem. If this is a feature you would like to see sooner, let us know by adding a discussion on GitHub."
