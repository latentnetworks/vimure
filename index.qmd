# 📑 Is this package for me?

Suppose you want to find out the "true" network of social ties between $n$ individuals and you query $m$ "reporters" within this network ($m \le n$) about such ties. These ties could, for instance, represent relationships commonly studied in the social sciences — such as loaning money, giving advice, or sharing food.

Suppose, also, that you ask them questions in both directions: _"Who **comes** to person $i$ to borrow money? But also, who does person $i$ **goes to** when borrowing money?"_ As it is very unlikely that the responses given by the reporters will match perfectly, you will almost surely end up with varying perspectives of the same social network. The question then is, how do you make sense of this data in face of noisy reports and potentially unreliable reporters?

The model contained in the **VIMuRe** package is our proposed solution to this problem. It fits latent network model from multiply-sampled social network data using Bayesian inference, returning a posterior distribution that can lately be used to obtain samples or a point-estimate network (as an igraph object). The package is written in Python and R and is available on GitHub.

## 📝 In brief

- **Input:** multiply-sampled social network data as a list of adjacency matrices or igraph objects. ^[<mark class="todo">**\#TODO**</mark>: Illustrate what this means.]

- **Output:** a fitted latent network model that can be used to obtain samples or a point-estimate network (an igraph object) from the posterior distribution of the fitted model. ^[<mark class="todo">**\#TODO**</mark>: Illustrate what this means.]
